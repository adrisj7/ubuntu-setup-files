# ubuntu-setup-files
I'm tired rewriting the same damn config files every time I install ubuntu on a new OS, and so here's a repo that allows me to install stuff to my personal preferences

You may copy individual files over for specific customization, or you may run the setup to get everything configured

FULL INSTALLATION STEPS:

1) Must have i3 window manager installed with `sudo apt update && sudo apt install i3`
2) Run the setup file
3) Run the color-config file for optional color scheme picking. This uses the [Gogh Color Scheme Picker](http://mayccoll.github.io/Gogh/)
